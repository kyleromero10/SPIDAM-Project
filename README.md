# SPIDAM
 
This program measures and analyzes reverberation time in a given file (if the file is not .wav, it will be converted to .wav)

## Usage

When you run the program a new GUI will open. Click on "Load Audio File" and your files will be opened. Click on the audio file you want to graph and click "Open" on the bottom right of the window. When the file loads a waveform graph will appear. Clicking on the other three buttons will cause other graphs to appear. The "Plot RT60" will cause low, mid, and high frequency graphs to appear. Clicking the "Merge Graphs" button will cause the low, mid, and high frequencies graphs to merge into one graph. Finally, clicking the "Show Spectogram" button will cause a spectrogram of your file to appear.
